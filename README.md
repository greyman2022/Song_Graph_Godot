# Song Graph (Godot)
a fun "song" graph to plop dots onto the scale of peak-mid and vibing-banger

There's an exe included, and I collect absolutely zero information, and have no way of knowing if you copy/redistribute this thing. If you do, please mention me, but it took me like 4.5 hours to make this so I don't have any real attachement to it. Enjoy!
